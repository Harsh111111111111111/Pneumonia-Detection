# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a patient is suffering from Pneumonia by analyzing chest X-ray images uploaded through a web application.

The trained deep learning model is integrated with a Flask-based web interface.

## ▶️ Steps to Run the Project (Using VS Code)

Download or clone the GitHub repository.

Option A: Click on "Code" → Download ZIP → Extract it

Option B: git clone <repository-link>

Open VS Code.

File → Open Folder

Select the project folder

Obtain the trained model file (pneumonia_detection_model.h5)

The model file is shared privately after payment

Place it in the main project folder (same level as app.py)

Open terminal in VS Code.

Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Flask application:
python app.py

If the server starts successfully, you will see:
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Open a browser and visit:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Upload a chest X-ray image and click on Predict.

The model will classify the image as:

Pneumonia

Normal
