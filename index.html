            <h3>Causes of Pneumonia</h3>
            <img src="static/images/causes.jpg" alt="Causes of Pneumonia" class="section-image">
            <p>Pneumonia is a serious infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other pathogens. The most common causes include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bacterial Infection:</strong> Bacteria like *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae* can lead to pneumonia.</li>
                <li><strong>Viral Infection:</strong> Viruses such as the flu virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and COVID-19 can cause pneumonia.</li>
                <li><strong>Fungal Infection:</strong> Fungi in the environment can cause pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Aspiration Pneumonia:</strong> This occurs when food, liquid, or vomit is inhaled into the lungs.</li>
                <li><strong>Inhalation of Toxic Substances:</strong> Inhalation of toxic gases or smoke can damage the lungs and cause pneumonia.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Serious Effects on the Body After Pneumonia</h3>
            <img src="static/images/effects.jpg" alt="Serious Effects of Pneumonia" class="section-image">
            <p>Pneumonia can have serious effects on the body, especially if left untreated. Some of the common complications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sepsis:</strong> Pneumonia can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening infection in the bloodstream.</li>
                <li><strong>Organ Failure:</strong> Severe pneumonia can result in organ failure, particularly in the kidneys and heart.</li>
                <li><strong>Lung Abscess:</strong> A pocket of pus can form in the lungs, requiring surgical drainage.</li>
                <li><strong>Respiratory Failure:</strong> In extreme cases, pneumonia can cause respiratory failure, where the lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body.</li>
                <li><strong>Chronic Health Problems:</strong> Some individuals, particularly older adults, may experience long-term lung damage and difficulty breathing even after recovery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Symptoms of Pneumonia</h3>
            <img src="static/images/symptoms.jpg" alt="Symptoms of Pneumonia" class="section-image">
            <p>The symptoms of pneumonia can vary depending on the cause and severity of the infection. Common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fever:</strong> A high fever is often one of the first signs of pneumonia.</li>
                <li><strong>Cough:</strong> A persistent cough, which may produce phlegm, is common.</li>
                <li><strong>Shortness of Breath:</strong> Difficulty breathing and rapid shallow breathing can occur.</li>
                <li><strong>Chest Pain:</strong> Sharp or stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breathing or coughing is common.</li>
                <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Feeling unusually tired or weak is another common symptom of pneumonia.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="static/images/precautions.jpg" alt="Precautions for Pneumonia" class="section-image">
            <p>To prevent pneumonia and reduce the risk of infection, you can follow these precautions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vaccination:</strong> Get vaccinated against pneumonia-causing bacteria like *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and the flu virus.</li>
                <li><strong>Hand Hygiene:</strong> Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after coughing or sneezing.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Smoking:</strong> Smoking damages the lungs and increases the risk of respiratory infections.</li>
                <li><strong>Boost Immunity:</strong> Eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep to keep your immune system strong.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Close Contact:</strong> Stay away from people who are sick, especially those with respiratory infections.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Follow the Treatment Plan:</strong> Take prescribed medications, including antibiotics or antivirals, as instructed by your doctor.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Self-Medicating:</strong> Do not take over-the-counter medications without consulting a healthcare professional.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor Symptoms:</strong> Keep track of your symptoms, and seek emergency care if you experience severe difficulty breathing or chest pain.</li>
